## Overview

Linear algebra is the foundation of many quantitative finance techniques:

- Portfolio optimization
- Risk modeling and management
- Derivatives pricing
- Factor models
- Time series analysis

The tools in this directory focus on both educational value (understanding the operations) and practical implementations optimized for financial applications.

## Implementation Philosophy

Each notebook follows these principles:

1. **Educational First**: Clear explanations of mathematical concepts and their financial applications
2. **Progressive Implementation**: Starting with basic implementations and evolving to production-ready code
3. **Type Safety**: Proper type hints to ensure code robustness
4. **Performance**: Benchmarking different approaches with a focus on optimizations needed for financial applications
5. **Financial Context**: Examples and applications specific to finance

## Usage

Each notebook can be used as:

- A learning resource for understanding the mathematical foundations of quantitative finance
- A reference for implementing these operations in your own financial models
- A benchmark for comparing different implementation approaches

## Requirements

Most notebooks require:
- Python 3.7+ (some advanced features require Python 3.10+)
- NumPy for optimized implementations
- Jupyter for interactive exploration

Additional dependencies are noted in each notebook.
